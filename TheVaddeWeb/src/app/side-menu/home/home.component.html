                  Is there any rice meal with more varieties than biryani? When it comes to biryani, 
                  there are thousands of different variations to choose from. 
                  It all relies on the type of food the Calgary Indian restaurant intends to provide. Rice, Indian spices, vegetables, 
                  eggs, and meat, including chicken, beef, and fish, are all available. You have an option.
